# sreality2excel
Tools for extracting advertisment data from sreality.cz and writing it to excel.

Developed and tested in Python 3.9.1.
To run instal dependencies in `requirements.txt` (for example by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then run the `main.py` file. If you want to add multiple advertisments at once, run the file with `-m` option (`python main.py -m`) and after you are done, end the program with Ctrl+C.
